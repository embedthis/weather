# EmbedThis Ioto Device Agent

The EmbedThis Ioto device agent is an IoT Device Management agent that can be
used for cloud-based management or direct management over a local network. 

Ioto provides everything you need in an IoT device agent, including: a HTTP web
server, HTTP client, MQTT client, embedded database and JSON data management.
Ioto offers extensive cloud-based management using the AWS IoT platform.
Integration is provided for cloud-based state persistency, provisioning, cloud
database sync and OTA device upgrading.

What is unique about Ioto, is that these components are tightly integrated to
give an extremely efficient and powerful device agent. Ioto's embedded database
will transparently sync device data to the cloud to enable effortless remote
management.

This distribution includes several [Sample Apps](./apps) to help you get
started with Ioto. You can also download the separate Ioto Apps package for a
suite of device management apps. 

See the [README-Cloud](./README-CLOUD.md) for more details about cloud-based
management.
See the [README-ESP32](./README-ESP32.md) for details about building Ioto for
the ESP32 platform.
See the [README-FREERTOS](./README-FREERTOS.md) for details about building Ioto
for the FreeRTOS platform.

Full documentation for the Ioto Agent, the Builder, Device Manager and Ioto
service is available at:

Each application has a README.md in the apps/APP directory that describes the
application.

## Building from Source

Ioto releases are available as source code distributions from the [Builder
Site](https://admin.embedthis.com/product). To download, first create an
account and login, then navigate to the product list, select the Ioto Eval and
click the download link.

[Download Source Package](https://admin.embedthis.com/product)

The Ioto source distribution contains all the required source files, headers,
and build tools. 

Ioto is cross-platform and runs on a wide variety of operating systems and CPU
architectures. EmbedThis offers different levels of verification for different
platforms. The platform support tiers are:

### Tier 1

Tier 1 platforms are those that are supported and verified by Ioto. Each
release is tested and verified on these platforms. The tier 1 platforms are:

- Linux
- Mac OS X
- Windows

### Tier 2

Tier 2 platforms are those that are supported by Ioto but each release is not
always tested and verified on these platforms. The tier 2 platforms are:

- ESP32
- FreeBSD
- FreeRTOS
- VxWorks

### Tier 3

Tier 3 platforms are those that customers have ported Ioto to and may work with
little or not effort by customers.

For tier 3 environments, you will need to cross-compile. The source code has
been designed to run on Arduino, ESP32, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS, Linux, Mac OS X,
VxWorks and other operating systems. Ioto supports the X86, X64, Riscv,
Riscv64, Arm, Arm64, and other CPU architectures. Ioto can be ported to new
platforms, operating systems and CPU architectures. Ask us if you need help
doing this.

See [Porting
Ioto](https://www.embedthis.com/doc/agent/user/hardware.html#porting-ioto-to-a-new-platform/) for porting details.

## Build Configuration

When building Ioto, you do not need to use a `configure` program. Instead, you
simply run **make** and select your desired App. This will copy the App's
configuration and conditionally compile the required services based on the
App's **ioto.json5** configuration settings. During the first time build, the
App's configuration will be copied to the **state/config** directory.

The selectable Ioto services are:

* ai -- Enable the AI service
* database -- Enable the embedded database
* keys -- Get AWS IAM keys for local AWS API invocation (dedicated clouds only)
* logs -- Capture log files and send to AWS CloudWatch logs (dedicated clouds
only)
* mqtt -- Enable MQTT protocol
* provision -- Dynamically provision keys and certificates for cloud based
management
* register -- Register with the Ioto Builder
* serialize -- Run a serialization service when making the device
* shadow -- Enable AWS IoT shadow state storage
* sync -- Enable transparent database synchronization with the cloud
* url -- Enable client HTTP request support
* web -- Enable the local embedded web server

## Building

If you are building on Windows, or for ESP32 or FreeRTOS, please read the
specific instructions for various build environments:

* [Building on Windows](#building-on-windows)
* [Building for the ESP32](README-ESP32.md) 
* [Building for FREERTOS](README-FREERTOS.md)

## Building with Make

To build on Linux, MacOS or Windows via WSL, use the system **make** command.
The supplied Makefile will build the Ioto library (libioto.a) and the "ioto"
main program. If you are embedding Ioto in another program, you should link the
Ioto library with your program. See [Linking](#linking-with-ioto) below for
details. 

To build, nominate your selected app via the "APP=NAME" makefile option. For
example:

    $ make APP=unit

## Building on Windows

For Windows, you can build one of three ways:

* Natively with Windows Visual Studio
* Using Windows Command Prompt and nmake
* Using Windows WSL using make

The easiest way to build is to use Windows WSL and make, but this yields a
lower performing executable. We recommend building with WSL initially to test
the Ioto agent.

### Building with Windows WSL

Using the [Windows SubSystem for Linux
(WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) you get a tightly
integrated Linux environment from which you can build and debug using VS Code.

To build, first [install
WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) by running the
following command as an administrator:

    $ wsl --install

Then invoke **wsl** to run a wsl (bash) shell:

    $ wsl

To configure WSL for building, install the following packages from the wsl
shell.

    $ apt update 
    $ apt install make gcc build-essential libc6-dev openssl libssl-dev

Then extract the Ioto source distribution:

    $ tar xvfz ioto-VERSION.tgz ioto

Finally build via **make**:

    $ cd ioto
    $ make

To debug with VS Code, add the [WSL
extentension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) to VS Code and then from a WSL terminal, open VS Code from the ioto directory:

    $ cd ioto
    $ code .

This will open a remote WSL project for the Ioto distribution.

### Building Natively on Windows

To build natively on Windows, you will need to install the compiler from the
Visual Studio Community Edition. You can download the installer from the
[Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). 

You will also need to install `vcpkg` to manage the dependencies and install
the required SSL libraries.

Newer versions of Visual Studio include Vcpkg. You can check if you have Vcpkg
installed by running:

```bash
    > vcpkg --version
```

If installed, you can skip these steps: If you do not have Vcpkg installed, you
can install it by running:

```bash
    > git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
    > cd vcpkg
    > .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    > .\vcpkg integrate install
```

Once installed, you can install the required Ioto dependencies:

```bash
$ vcpkg install
```

OpenSSL will be installed to:

* -I<vcpkg-root>\installed\x64-windows\include
* -L<vcpkg-root>\installed\x64-windows\lib


Vcpkg is automatically configured for building with Visual Studio. For `nmake`
you will need to set the ME_COM_OPENSSL_PATH environment variable to the path
to the OpenSSL installation.

### Building with Windows Visual Studio

To build natively with Visual Studio, open the Ioto solution file:

    projects/ioto-windows-default/ioto.sln

For debug, set the "Debug" configuration and build the project. Then select
`ioto` as the startup project.  Edit the `ioto` properties and set the working
directory to the `${ProjectDir}\..\..` which is the Ioto root directory.

You can change the included Ioto demo application by editing the `APP` property
for the `app` project. It is set to `demo` by default.  After changing, do a
clean rebuild of the project.

### Building with Nmake and Windows Command Prompt

You can build natively on windows the command line. First set the environment
variables for the Visual Studio version you are using:

```bash
c:\Program Files\Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat
```

Next, install the Vcpkg and OpenSSL dependencies as described above in the
[Building Natively](#building-natively) section.

Once the dependencies are installed, define the path to the OpenSSL
installation so the build can find the headers and libraries by setting the
`ME_COM_OPENSSL_PATH` environment variable.

Then build the Ioto project with `make`. This will run the `make.bat` script
which will invoke `nmake` to build the Ioto project. For example:

```bash
SET ME_COM_OPENSSL_PATH=C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows
make
```

## Running the Ioto Command

To run Ioto, type:

    $ make run

or add the directory **build/bin** to your PATH environment variable and invoke
directly.

    export PATH=`make path`

    $ ioto -v

on Windows:

```bash
SET PATH=%PATH%;%CD%\build\bin
ioto -v
```

If your selected app enables the web server, Ioto will listen for connections
on ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS and serve documents from the **site**
directory when run with the **dev** profile. When run with the **prod**
profile, it will serve documents from **/var/www/ioto**. You can change the
listening ports in **web.json5**.

## Running the Web Server

If you only require local management and do not need cloud-based management or
the embedded database, you can run the web server directly by running the
**web** program instead of the **ioto** program. For example:

    $ web

This will start the web server listening on ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
and serve documents from the **site** directory.

You can change the listening ports in **web.json5**.

## Changing the TLS Stack

Ioto includes support for two TLS stacks: OpenSSL and MbedTLS. Ioto is built
with OpenSSL by default. OpenSSL is a leading open source TLS stack that is
faster, but bigger. MbedTLS is a compact TLS implementation. When built for
ESP32, the supplied ESP32 MbedTLS stack will be used.

To build with MbedTLS, install MbedTLS version 3 or later using your O/S
package manager. 

For example on Mac OS:

    $ brew install mbedtls

Then build with MbedTLS:

    $ make ME_COM_MBEDTLS=1 ME_COM_OPENSSL=0

## Embedding Ioto

If you wish to embed the Ioto library in your main program, such as you will do
with FreeRTOS, you will need to include the **ioto.h** header in your source
and call Ioto APIs to initialize and run. 

### Including Ioto

In your main program, use:

```c
#include "ioto.h"

int main() {
    // If FreeRTOS, you need to call vTaskStartScheduler() before ioRun

    //  Start the Ioto runtime
    ioStartRuntime(1);

    //  Run Ioto services until instructed to exit
    ioRun(ioStart);

    ioStopRuntime();
}

int ioStart() {
    //  This is invoked by ioRun when Ioto is ready
    //  Put your user code here
}
void ioStop() {
    //  This is invoked by ioRun when Ioto is shutting down
}
```

### Linking with the Ioto Library

To compile, reference the Ioto include directory. For example:

    $ gcc -I/path/to/ioto/build/inc

To link, reference the Ioto library

For example:

    $ cc -o prog -I .../ioto/build/inc -L .../ioto/build/bin main.c -lioto
-lssl -lcrypto 

If you are building with OpenSSL or MbedTLS, you will probably need to add
those libraries to the link path. For example with OpenSSL:

    $ gcc -lcrypto -lssl

### Fiber Stacks

Ioto uses [fiber coroutines](https://www.embedthis.com/agent/doc/dev/fiber/)
for parallelism instead of threads or callbacks. This results in a faster and
simpler codebase. Each fiber has a stack. On Linux, MacOS and Windows, the
stacks are grown automatically as required from an initial stack size of 32K
(64K on Windows). On other platforms such as FreeRTOS or systems without an
MMU, the stack size is fixed. On such platforms, it is recommended that you
limit the use of large stack-based allocations and use heap allocations
instead. It is also advised to limit the use of recursive algorithms.

The initial size of a fiber stack is defined via the **limits.fiberStack**
property (previously `limits.stack`in the **ioto.json5** configuration file. 

For Linux, MacOS and Windows, you can configure the maximum stack size and the
stack growth increment via the properties: **limits.fiberStackMax** and
**limits.fiberStackGrow**. If a fiber is reused from the pool, the stack size
can be reset to the initial size if the stack is largeer than the initial size
via the **limits.fiberStackReset** property.

```json5
limits: {
    fiberStack: '32k',
    fiberStackMax: '256k',
    fiberStackGrow: '16k',
    fiberStackReset: '64k'
}
```

## Build Profiles

You can change Ioto's build and execution **profile** by editing the
**ioto.json5** configuration file. Two build profiles are supported:

-   dev
-   prod

The **dev** profile will configure Ioto suitable for developement. It will
define use local directories for state, web site and config files. It will also
define the "optimize" property to be "debug" which will build Ioto with debug
symbols.

The **prod** profile will build Ioto suitable for production deployment. It
will define system standard directories for state, web site and config files.
It will also define the "optimize" property to be set to "release" which will
build Ioto optimized without debug symbols. 

The **ioto.json5** configuration file has some conditional properties that are
applied depending on the selected **profile**. These properties are nested
under the **conditional** property and the relevant set are copied to overwrite
properties of the same name at the top level. This allows a single
configuration file to apply different settings based on the current value of
the profile property.

You can override the **"optimize"** property by building with a
"OPTIMIZE=release" or "OPTIMIZE=debug" make environment variable.

## Tests

The test suite is located in the `test/` directory and uses the
[TestMe](https://www.embedthis.com/testme/) framework. 

The test suite requires the following prerequisites:

- **Bun**: v1.2.23 or later
- **TestMe**: Test runner (installed globally)

Install Bun by following the instructions at: 

    https://bun.com/docs/installation

Install TestMe globally with:

    bun install -g --trust @embedthis/testme

Run the tests with:

    make test

or manually via the `tm` command. 

    tm

To run a specific test or group of tests, use the `tm` command with the test
name.

    tm basic/

### Other Test Suites

The distribution includes test suites for: tracking memory leaks, fuzz testing
and performance benchmarking.

* [Memory Leak Testing](test/web/leak/)
