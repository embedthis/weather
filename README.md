# Ioto Sample Weather App

This is a demonstration app that simulates a simple device sensor app by creating a simulated weather station that sends weather information to the cloud.

It uses the Ioto HTTP client APIs to get weather information simulating a local device sensor.

The app captures user input to select the desired city and displays the weather information in the device app.
