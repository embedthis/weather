# Ioto Sample Weather App

This is a demonstration app that simulates a simple device sensor app. It creates a simulated weather station that sends weather information to the cloud.

It uses the HTTP client APIs to get weather information simulating a local device sensor.  We do this so the sample can run on any platform that has an HTTP client.

The app captures user input to select the desired city.
